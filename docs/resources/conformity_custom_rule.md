# Resource `conformity_custom_rule`
Allows you to create Custom Rules on Conformity

There are 6 Custom rule that is being tested
  1.Storage Naming for all 3 clouds (aws,azure and gcp)
  2.MongoDB port restriction for all 3 clouds.(aws,azure and gcp)


1.Storage Naming for all 3 clouds (aws,azure and gcp)

## Storage Naming for aws

  ### For Running the Create Custom Rule API  for aws
    1.First you have the aws access so that you can create a bucket for it 
    2.while creating the bucket give appropriate name to bucket 
    3.Run the Create Custom Rule api by giving required value 
        -> resourceType,service and provider
        -> resourceType and service you can find from the documentation of the api
         there was a link for resourceType and services just click that you will get response
         find the appropriate resourceType and services
    4.After giving the reesourceType and services and provider set the rule appropriately and also the condition which will check for the bucket name which you  have created
    5.Run the api 
    
  ### Checking the custom rule
    6.Copy the id from the successfull response
    7.Run the Run Custom Rule api by passing the accountId of your aws account and rule id (which you will get in Create Custom Rule api response)
    8.Copy the same body of Create Custom Rule api 
    9.Run the api you will see your bucket details over there and your rule status whether its failed / Success
  
  ### If you dont know the Bucket Details and also what to pass in path of attributes and rules
    1.You need to run the Run Custom Rule api by providing the aws accoundid and the rule idand also the set the resourceData=true
    2. In body you need to pass 
    ```
    {
          "configuration": {
            "name": "S3 bucket logging enabled",
            "description": "S3 buckets have logging enabled",
            "service": "S3",
            "resourceType": "s3-bucket",
            "attributes": [
              {
                "name": "bucketLogging",
                "path": "data.LoggingEnabled",
                "required": true
              }
            ],
            "rules": [
              {
                "conditions": {
                  "all": [
                    {
                      "value": null,
                      "operator": "notEqual",
                      "fact": "bucketLogging"
                    }
                  ]
                },
                "event": {
                  "type": "Bucket has logging enabled"
                }
              }
            ],
            "severity": "MEDIUM",
            "categories": [
              "security"
            ],
            "provider": "aws",
            "enabled": true
          }
        }
    
    
    ```
  3.Change the resourceType,services and  provider appropriately
  4.Put the same rule as Create Custom Rule Api
  5.Save and send you will see your bucketdetails and status of your rule and the resourceData details in which you can see all the bucket details where you can create a rule in any of the attributes


## Example Usage of Create Custom Rule API for aws
```hcl
AWS Storage Naming-:
        resource "conformity_custom_rule" "example"{
          name= "S3 Bucket Custom Rule"
          description      = "This custom rule ensures S3 buckets follow our best practice updated"
        	remediation_notes = "If this is broken, please follow these steps:\n1. Step one \n2. Step two\n updated"
        	service          = "S3"
        	resource_type     = "s3-bucket"
        	categories       = ["security"]
        	severity         = "HIGH"
        	cloud_provider   = "aws"
        	enabled          = true
        	attributes {
        		name     = "bucketName"
        		path     = "data.Name"
        		required = true
        	  }
        	  rules {
        	    operation = "all"
        		conditions {
        		  fact     = "bucketName"
        		  operator = "pattern"
        		  value    = "^shunyekaa$"
        		}
        		event_type = "Bucket name is longer than 32 characters"
        	  }
  }

  ### If you dont know the Storage Account Details and also what to pass in path of attributes and rules
    1.You need to run the Run Custom Rule api by providing the azure accoundId and the rule id and also the set the resourceData=true
    2. In body you need to pass the same "configuration details as passed above in aws"

## Mongo DB Port Restriction  for gcp

   ### For Running the Create Custom Rule API  for azure
    1.First you have the gcp access so that you can create a Firewall Rules
    2.while creating the Firewall Rules  give appropriate name of Network security group 
        ->Set the Inbound and Outbound rule by giving the port,protocols and other details properly
    3.Run the Create Custom Rule api by giving required value 
        -> resourceType,service and provider

         there was a link for resourceType and services just click that you will get response
         find the appropriate resourceType and services
    4.After giving the resourceType and services and provider set the rule appropriately for port restriction
    5.Run the api 
    
  ### Checking the custom rule

    7.Run the Run Custom Rule api by passing the accountId of your gcp account and rule id (which you will get in Create Custom Rule api response)
    8.Copy the same body of Create Custom Rule api 
    9.Run the api you will see your bucket details over there and your rule status whether its failed / Success
  
  ### If you dont know the Firewall Rule  Details and also what to pass in path of attributes and rules
    1.You need to run the Run Custom Rule api by providing the azure accoundid and the rule id and also the set the resourceData=true
    2. In body you need to pass "configuration details as passed above in aws" 
    3.Just change the resourceType,service ,provider and other related details
