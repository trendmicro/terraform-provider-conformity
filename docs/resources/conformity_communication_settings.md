## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

 - `id` - The ID of the Communication Setting in Conformity managed by this resource

Example usage on the template:

```hcl
setting {
    id = conformity_communication_setting.email_setting.id
}
```

## Import
Comunication Settings - Can import based on the resource_id that can be found under the outputs upon creation or inspect element.

Run `terraform init`:
```hcl
terraform init
```

Import the conformity_communication_setting resources into Terraform. Replace the {RESOURCE-NAME} and {RESOURCE-ID} value.
```hcl
terraform import conformity_communication_setting.{RESOURCE-NAME} {RESOURCE-ID}
```

Use the `state` subcommand to verify Terraform successfully imported the conformity_communication_setting resources.
```hcl
terraform state show conformity_communication_setting.{RESOURCE-NAME}
```

Run `terraform show -no-color >> main.tf` to import the resources on the `main.tf` file. Make sure you remove the id from the imported resource.
```hcl
terraform show -no-color >> main.tf
```
